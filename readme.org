[[./readme.ja.org][Japanese Manual]]

* About ac-clang
  The original version is emacs-clang-complete-async.

  https://github.com/Golevka/emacs-clang-complete-async

  The above fork and it was extended.

* Provide Features
  The C/C++ Code Completion and the jump to definition/declaration/inclusion-file is provided by libclang.

  [[./sample-pic-complete.png]]


** Basic Features
   - C/C++/Objective-C Code Completion
   - Syntax Check by flymake
   - Jump and return for definition/declaration
     It isn't necessary to generate a tag file beforehand, and it's possible to jump by on-the-fly.
     But this feature is not perfect.
     Because, the case you can't jump well also exists.

** Extended Features
   The original version is non-implementation.

   - The number of launch of clang-server is change to 1 process per Emacs.
     The original is 1 process per buffer.
     The clang-server is create a session and holds CFLAGS per source code buffer.
   - The template parameters expand
     Template parameters expand is possible at the time of arguments expand after completion.
   - Completion by manual operation
     It can be completion at any position.
   - Display brief comment of completion candidate
     brief comment show on minibuffer.
   - libclang CXTranslationUnit Flags support
     It is setable on lisp.
   - libclang CXCodeComplete Flags support
     It is setable on lisp.
   - Multibyte support
     Modified, because the original is not enough multibyte support.
   - Jump and return for inclusion file.
   - IPC packet format can be specified
     S-Expression, Json
   - Debug Logger
     Used for debugging.
     You are possible to confirm the message and the data that client was sent to clang-server.
   - Performance Profiler
     Measure the performance of client / server.
   - Miscellaneous
     Small change and addition

** Optional Features
   The original version is non-implementation.
   Mainly Windows Platform support.

   - Project file generation by CMake.
     Visual Studio Project and Linux Makefile support.
   - Microsoft Visual Studio Platform support
     clang-server and libclang.dll(clang5.0.0 RELEASE/FINAL) was built by Microsoft Visual Studio 2017/2015/2013
   - x86_64 Machine Architecture + Windows Platform support
     Required if you want to completion code for Visual Studio.(for _WIN64 build support)
     clang-server and libclang.dll is 64/32bit version.
     The binary was built by Visual Studio.
     Therefore, this also has become to those that conform to the machine architecture type of Visual Studio compiler predefined macros.
     If you build by mingw environment, Visual Studio predefined macros is interfere or not defined.

** Other difference
   clang-server is described by C++.(The original is C)

* Installation(external program)
** Linux & Windows(self-build)
   Please installation is reference to the manual of clang-server for self-build.
   
   [[file:./clang-server/readme.org][Clang Server Manual]]

** Windows(If you use redistributable release binary)
*** Installation of Visual C++ Redistributable Package
    If you don't install Visual Studio 2017/2015/2013, required Visual C++ Redistributable Package.
    Please installer gets the vcredist_x64.exe from following page.

    - 2017
      https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/?q=#other
    - 2015
      http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53587
    - 2013
      http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40784

*** A copy of the external program
    https://github.com/yaruopooner/ac-clang/releases

    Please download the latest clang-server-X.X.X.zip from above, and unpack to ac-clang directory.

    ac-clang/clang-server/binary/clang-server.exe
    ac-clang/clang-server/library/x86_XX/release/libclang.dll
    You have to copy this two files to valid path.
    e.g. /usr/local/bin

** Precautions
   libclang is not same the LLVM official binary.
   Official libclang has problem that file is locked by LLVM file system used mmap.
   libclang which is being distributed here solved the problem by patch applied to official source code.
   If you want LLVM self-build, you have to apply a patch for solve the above problem.

* Installation(lisp package)
** Required Packages
   Emacs built-in packages and installation required packages.

   - flymake(built-in)
   - auto-complete
   - pos-tip
   - yasnippet

** Configuration of ac-clang
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (require 'ac-clang)
    
   (ac-clang-initialize)
   #+end_src

   It is complete.
   If you call (ac-clang-initialize), a clang-server will resident.

   If you want to use debug version, the following settings are required before (ac-clang-initialize) execution.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (require 'ac-clang)

   (ac-clang-server-type 'debug)
   (ac-clang-initialize) 
   #+end_src

* How to use
** Configuration of libclang flags
   It will change the flag of clang-server in the following way

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq ac-clang-clang-translation-unit-flags FLAG-STRING)
   (setq ac-clang-clang-complete-at-flags FLAG-STRING)
   (ac-clang-initialize)
   #+end_src

   Configuration value is necessary to be set to variable before the initialization function execution.
   Configuration value change after the clang-server launch, uses (ac-clang-update-clang-parameters).

** Configuration of CFLAGS
   CFLAGS have to set to variable before ac-clang activation.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq ac-clang-cflags CFLAGS)
   #+end_src
   It's set by this.

** Activation
   To execute the completion you need to create the source code buffer session on clang-server.
   CFLAGS set to ac-clang-cflags after following execution.
   Run the activate function below after CFLAGS set to ac-clang-cflags.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (ac-clang-activate)
   #+end_src
   Therefore, session associated with buffer is created on clang-server.

   - Lazy Activation
     You can delay the activation until the buffer is changed.
     This is used instead of (ac-clang-activate).
     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (ac-clang-activate-after-modify)
     #+end_src
     If you want to use this activation, it is better to run at c-mode-common-hook.

** Deactivation
   Delete the session created on clang-server.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (ac-clang-deactivate)
   #+end_src
   
** Update of libclang flags
   It will change the flag of clang-server in the following way

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq ac-clang-clang-translation-unit-flags FLAG-STRING)
   (setq ac-clang-clang-complete-at-flags FLAG-STRING)
   (ac-clang-update-clang-parameters)
   #+end_src

   Before carrying out this function, the flag of a created session isn't changed.
   A new flag is used for the created session after this function execution.

** Update of CFLAGS
   If there is a CFLAGS of updated after the session creation , there is a need to update the CFLAGS of the session .
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq ac-clang-cflags CFLAGS)
   (ac-clang-update-cflags)
   #+end_src
   When you do this, CFLAGS of the session will be updated.

   This has the same effect.
   But (ac-clang-update-cflags) is small cost than following.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (ac-clang-deactivate)
   (ac-clang-activate)
   #+end_src

** Debug Logger
   When you make the following settings
   The contents sent to clang-server are output to a buffer as "*clang-log*".
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq ac-clang-debug-log-buffer-p t)
   #+end_src

   It will put a limit on the logger buffer size.
   If buffer size larger than designation size, the buffer is cleared.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq ac-clang-debug-log-buffer-size (* 1024 1000))
   #+end_src

   If you don't want to be erased a logger buffer, you can set as follows.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq ac-clang-debug-log-buffer-size nil)
   #+end_src

** Profiler
   When you make the following settings
   Profile result at command execution is output to "*Messages*".
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq ac-clang-debug-profiler-p t)
   #+end_src
   #+end_src

** Completion
*** Auto Completion
    Completion is executed when the following key input is performed just after the class or the instance object or pointer object.
    - =.=
    - =->=
    - =::=
     
    If you want to invalidate autocomplete, it will set as follows.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq ac-clang-async-autocompletion-automatically-p nil)
    #+end_src

*** Manual Completion
    Completion is executed when the following key input is performed.
    - =<tab>=

    Position to perform the key input is the same as auto-completion of the above-mentioned.
    And it is possible completions between word of method or property.
    #+begin_src objc-mode
    struct Foo
    {
        int     m_property0;
        int     m_property1;
     
        void    method( int in )
        {
        }
    };

    Foo        foo;
    Foo*       foo0 = &foo;

    foo.
    -----
        ^  Execute a manual completion here.

    foo->
    ------
         ^  Execute a manual completion here.

    Foo::
    ------
         ^  Execute a manual completion here.

    foo.m_pro
    ----------
             ^  Execute a manual completion here.
    #+end_src

    Also, if you want to completion the method of Objective-C/C++, you can only manually completion.
    #+begin_src objc-mode
    id obj = [[NSString alloc] init];
    [obj 
    ------
         ^  Execute a manual completion here.
    #+end_src

    When manual completion is invalidate or keybind change, it will set as follows.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; disable
    (setq ac-clang-async-autocompletion-manualtrigger-key nil)
    ;; other key
    (setq ac-clang-async-autocompletion-manualtrigger-key "M-:")
    #+end_src

** Jump and return for definition/declaration/inclusion-file
   In the activated buffer, you move the cursor at word that want to jump.
   Execute following, you can jump to the source file that the class / method / function / enum / macro did definition or declaration.
   This is possible jump to inclusion file.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (ac-clang-jump-smart)
   #+end_src
   Keybind is "M-,"

   The return operation is possible in the following.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (ac-clang-jump-back)
   #+end_src
   Keybind is "M-,"

   The jump history is stacked, enabling continuous jump and continuous return. 
   If you execute jump operation in non-activation buffer, that buffer is automatically activated and jump.

   - =(ac-clang-jump-smart)=
     1st priority jump location is the definition. 
     But if the definition is not found, it will jump to the declaration.
     Jump to inclusion-file.( Please run the command on the =#include= keyword )
   - =(ac-clang-jump-inclusion)=
     Jump to inclusion-file.
   - =(ac-clang-jump-definition)=
     Jump to definition.
   - =(ac-clang-jump-declaration)=
     Jump to declaration.

* Limitation
** Jump for definition(ac-clang-jump-definition / ac-clang-jump-smart) is not perfect.
   The function / class method are subject to restrictions.
   struct/class/typedef/template/enum/class-variable/global-variable/macro/preprocessor don't have problem.
   libclang analyze current buffer and including headers by current buffer, and decide jump location from result.
   Therefore, when function definition and class method definition is described in including headers, it is possible to jump.
   If it is described in c / cpp, it is impossible to jump. Because libclang can't know c / cpp.
   1st priority jump location is the declaration. 
   But if the declaration is not found, it will jump to the definition.
   When emphasizing a definition jump, I'll recommend you use with GNU global(GTAGS).

* Known Issues
  nothing
